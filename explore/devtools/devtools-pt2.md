1. The bug is that the value is passed in as strings and stored as strings, thus we returned the sum of the two strings of the numbers.
2. we can change line 11 to let result = parseInt(num1) + parseInt(num2), so that num1 and num2 are mapped to integers and then the result would be the sum of the integers.
